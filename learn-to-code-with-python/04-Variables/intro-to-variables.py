Rules of variables in python:

No spaces are allowed.

The first character must be a letter (lowercase or uppercase)
or an underscore.

Only letters, numbers and underscores are permitted after 
the first character.

Variable names are case-sensitive. ​name​ and ​Name​ are two 
distinct, separate variables.

Variable names should describe the data that they are referencing.

Use underscores to separate multiple words. This is called snake 
case style because the text resembles a snake.
